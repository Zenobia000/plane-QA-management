# Deliver an Approved Vertical Slice

Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the requested requirement, scenario, or bounded vertical
slice. Unless the user asks for plan/review only, invocation authorizes in-scope
local code, test, and documentation changes. It does not authorize commits,
pushes, PRs, destructive migrations, deployments, paid services, or production
access.

Read [references/delivery-contract.md](references/delivery-contract.md) before
planning the slice.

Write in the engineering register (L3) defined in
[../../rules/language-register.md](../../rules/language-register.md): be precise
about interfaces, fields, and commands. Trace business motivation to L1/L2 IDs
rather than restating it as implementation rationale.

## Readiness check

1. Read `docs/document-system/INDEX.md`, traceability, and only the in-scope
   approved PRD/BDD/SAD/ADR sections plus any affected contracts
   (openapi.yaml, db_design, ui_spec).
2. Confirm the target maps to an approved `FR/NFR`, `ACPT-ID`, observable
   `SCN-ID`, compatible architecture, and no unresolved blocking decision.
3. Inspect the working tree, project instructions, neighboring implementation,
   and real build/test/lint commands. Preserve unrelated user changes.
4. If specifications conflict or implementation would change external behavior,
   stop and route the issue back through `/specify`.

## Slice the work

1. **Check the board first.** Read `engineering_tracker.xlsx` ③ 切片看板. If the
   requested scope already has `SLC-*` rows, take the **frontier** — open,
   unclaimed, every blocker complete — and skip to step 4. Do not re-slice work
   that is already sliced.
2. **If not yet sliced, slice it.** Follow
   [references/slicing-contract.md](references/slicing-contract.md): vertical
   (not horizontal), independently verifiable, sized to fit one fresh context
   window, seam already confirmed by `/specify`. Prefactoring goes first. A wide
   refactor takes the expand–contract sequence instead of a tracer bullet.
3. **Confirm the breakdown with the human, then write the board.** Present the
   numbered list with blocking edges and what each slice delivers; iterate until
   approved. Only then write rows in dependency order. Writing follows the
   concurrency rules in
   [`docs/document-system/ticket-tracker.md`](../../../docs/document-system/ticket-tracker.md)
   §6 — sole writer, lock file, batched write-back.
4. **Claim before working.** Write `認領者` and `認領時間` on the chosen slice
   _before_ any implementation. Reversing this order lets two sessions collide on
   one slice.
5. Map `FR/NFR → ACPT/SCN → files/interfaces → tests → verification commands`
   for the claimed slice only.
6. Use Claude Code native task tracking for the current session. Do not create or
   update TaskMaster state, hidden session snapshots, or another roadmap.
7. Select existing professional skills only when relevant:
   `sunnydata-api-design`, `sunnydata-shadcn-ui`, `sunnydata-testing`,
   `sunnydata-security`, `sunnydata-debugging`, `sunnydata-codebase-design`, or
   architecture/code review skills. Do not preload the entire library.
8. Identify schema migrations, compatibility risks, credentials, external
   effects, and rollback needs.

**One slice per session.** Finish the claimed slice, write the board, then start
a fresh context for the next one — see the Context hygiene section in
[../../WORKFLOW.md](../../WORKFLOW.md). Carrying one slice's implementation
detail into the next is how long-horizon work degrades.

## Implementation authorization

State the slice, file/test map, assumptions, and material risks before editing,
then proceed with the authorized local work. Stop for clarification only when
the approved artifacts conflict, a missing decision materially changes behavior,
or the required action expands beyond the requested scope.

## Implement

1. Add or update tests in proportion to risk, covering the approved scenario and
   applicable failure behavior.
2. Implement the minimal compatible change. Do not silently change requirements,
   architecture, public contracts, or data policy.
3. Run the approved project checks incrementally. A failing check triggers
   diagnosis; it does not authorize broader refactoring.
4. Keep native task state aligned with completed work. Record newly discovered
   specification issues separately.
5. Update project documentation only when the approved implementation changes a
   documented interface or operational fact.
6. **Review before handoff.** Run `sunnydata-code-review` — its two-axis pass
   checks the diff against repo standards _and_ against the originating
   `FR/ACPT/SCN`. A slice that passes standards but implements the wrong thing is
   not done.

## Human Gate: external actions

Require separate explicit approval before commit, push, PR creation, destructive
migration, deployment, paid service use, or production access. A successful
implementation is not implicit authorization for these actions.

## Handoff

Report completed `FR/NFR`, `ACPT` and `SCN` IDs, changed files, commands actually run,
results, unverified items, residual risks, and the recommended `/verify`
invocation. Never report success from expectation or a subagent claim alone.

Write the slice back to ③ 切片看板 as `待驗證` with its evidence link. **Only
`/verify` may write `完成`**, and only against real evidence — an implementer
declaring its own slice done breaks
[golden-rules](../../rules/golden-rules.md) §4.
