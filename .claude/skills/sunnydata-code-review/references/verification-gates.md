# Verification Gates (Phase 1 detail)

Load this reference before claiming any status, completion, or success.

## Common Failures Table

| Claim                 | Requires                        | Not Sufficient                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Tests pass            | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass"    |
| Linter clean          | Linter output: 0 errors         | Partial check, extrapolation   |
| Build succeeds        | Build command: exit 0           | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed             | Test original symptom: passes   | Code changed, assumed fixed    |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified        | Test passes once               |
| Agent completed       | VCS diff shows changes          | Agent reports "success"        |
| Requirements met      | Line-by-line checklist          | Tests passing                  |

## Rationalization Prevention Table

| Excuse                                  | Reality                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| "Should work now"                       | RUN the verification        |
| "I'm confident"                         | Confidence is not evidence  |
| "Just this once"                        | No exceptions               |
| "Linter passed"                         | Linter is not compiler      |
| "Agent said success"                    | Verify independently        |
| "I'm tired"                             | Exhaustion is not an excuse |
| "Partial check is enough"               | Partial proves nothing      |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter          |

## Red Flags — STOP Immediately

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!")
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports without checking VCS diff
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- ANY wording implying success without having run verification

## Key Verification Patterns

**Tests:**

```
CORRECT:   [Run test command] → [See: 34/34 pass] → "All tests pass"
INCORRECT: "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green cycle — mandatory):**

```
CORRECT:   Write test → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
INCORRECT: "I've written a regression test" (without completing the red-green cycle)
```

**Build:**

```
CORRECT:   [Run build] → [See: exit 0] → "Build passes"
INCORRECT: "Linter passed" (linter does not check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**

```
CORRECT:   Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each item → Report gaps or completion
INCORRECT: "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**

```
CORRECT:   Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes exist → Report actual state
INCORRECT: Trust agent report at face value
```
